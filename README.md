![alt=""](Images/application-image.png)

## Background
After waiting for years and passing several tests, the Martian Aerospace Agency selected you to become part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, they chose you to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. You decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named KaseiCoin. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)
KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant. You’ll launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

## Steps Completed:
* Compiled all contracts using Remix/Ganache/Metamask and Injected Web 3.
* Deployed all contracts as well using Remix/Ganache/Metamask.
* Took anaimated .gif of all actions with the exception of the testing the actual crowdsale as we received some errors about the user does not minter role which I was not able to solve.

## Evaluation Evidence
[KaseiCoin Compilation with Error and fix](https://recordit.co/nk2R33UbqC) - we could only compile using 0.5.5 compiler, not the 0.5.0 as mentioned in the requirements.
